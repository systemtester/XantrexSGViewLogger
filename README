Xantrex Inverter Logger

Pulled together from various sites this script generates a log file that is similar to the Windows based SG View software.
Its existence then allows a suitably configured PVOuput Integration Service to parse the contents and upload to that site.

This script currently runs every minute on a Fedora box.
The crontab -e with both services running looks like
@reboot cd "/usr/local/org.pvoutput.integration.v1.4.0.2/bin"; ./pvoutput.sh &
* * * * * cd "/usr/local"; ./XantrexLogger.pl &
